# :clipboard: Orders-Scritp
Simple script to process orders, send emails and notify clients

## Modules

* `reportlab` to create the PDF
* `tkinter` to choose the file
* `pandas` to manage de `.xslx` file

## Extra

* The output is a folder with all the requests in pdf format.
* I used `auto-py-to-exe` to generate the `.exe` files.
